# Iris Flowers Classification

Welcome to the "Iris Flowers Classification" project, a part of my machine learning portfolio. In this project, I have developed a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into different species based on sepal and petal measurements using scikit-learn.

## Project Overview

- **Algorithm:** Machine Learning with scikit-learn
- **Programming Language:** Python

## Dataset

I used the well-known Iris dataset to classify Iris flowers into species. The dataset contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three different Iris species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

## Data Preprocessing

- Imported necessary libraries including NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn.
- Loaded the Iris dataset.
- Selected features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) as independent variables.
- Assigned Iris species as the target (dependent variable).
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
