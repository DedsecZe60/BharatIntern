# Iris Flowers Classification

Welcome to the "Iris Flowers Classification" project, a part of my machine learning portfolio. In this project, I have developed a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into different species based on sepal and petal measurements using scikit-learn.

**Author:** [Your Name]

## Project Overview

- **Algorithm:** Machine Learning with scikit-learn
- **Programming Language:** Python

## Dataset

I used the well-known Iris dataset to classify Iris flowers into species. The dataset contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three different Iris species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

## Data Preprocessing

- Imported necessary libraries including NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn.
- Loaded the Iris dataset.
- Selected features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) as independent variables.
- Assigned Iris species as the target (dependent variable).
- Split the data into training and testing sets.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Step 1: Load the Iris Dataset
iris = load_iris()
data = iris.data
target = iris.target

# Step 2: Data Preprocessing
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data, target, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Step 3: Train a Classifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 4: Make Predictions
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Step 5: Evaluate the Model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
