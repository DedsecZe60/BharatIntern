# Machine Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects repository, where I explore and implement various machine learning models. This repository includes projects related to house price prediction, wine quality prediction, and iris flowers classification, all implemented in Python.

## Project 1: House Price Prediction
* **Description:** This project focuses on predicting house prices using a linear regression model. The Jupyter notebook code demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate the model.
* **Code:** [House Price Prediction Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/DedsecZe60/BharatIntern/blob/main/House%20Price%20Prediction)

## Project 2: Wine Quality Prediction
* **Description:** In this project, I have developed a machine learning model to predict the quality of wine using linear regression. The Jupyter notebook code explains the process and provides insights into wine quality prediction.
* **Code:** [Wine Quality Prediction Jupyter Notebook]()

## Project 3: Iris Flowers Classification
* **Description:** This project involves the classification of different species of iris flowers based on the length of their petals and sepals. The Jupyter notebook showcases the implementation of the classification model.
* **Code:** [Iris Flowers Classification Jupyter Notebook]()
